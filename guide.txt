🔧 How to Build Each Feature
1. Interactive Map (Community-Level Risks)
•	Tool Options:
o	Plotly + Dash (Python, web-based, flexible).
o	Leaflet.js (JavaScript library for maps).
o	Tableau / Power BI (drag-and-drop, less coding).
•	How to do it:
o	Get latitude/longitude or district shapefiles (FS-COR data may have administrative boundaries).
o	Overlay vulnerability indicators (e.g., food insecurity, climate exposure).
o	Use color coding (red = high risk, green = low risk).
o	Add hover pop-ups with details: “District X – Drought Exposure: 70%, Nutrition Adequacy: 45%”.
👉 What makes you stand out: Add layer toggles (user can view only food insecurity, or only climate, etc.)

2. Trends Over Time (Graphs)
•	Tool Options: Plotly, Matplotlib/Seaborn (Python), or Tableau.
•	How to do it:
o	Use line charts for “Nutrition adequacy over last 5 years”.
o	Use bar charts for “Comparison between regions”.
o	Add playable time slider: policymakers can scroll year-by-year to see changes.
👉 Stand out by adding forecasting: Use simple ML (like ARIMA or Prophet in Python) to show “expected drought exposure in 2026”. Policymakers love forward-looking insights.

3. Filters (Region, Type of Vulnerability)
•	How to do it:
o	Dashboards (Tableau, Dash, Power BI) let you add dropdowns or checkboxes.
o	Users can filter:
	Country → Region → District.
	Vulnerability Type: Climate, Food Security, Nutrition.
•	Example: “Show me only Uganda, Climate Exposure, last 3 years.”
👉 Stand out by adding multi-layer filters (e.g., “Show only communities with high drought risk AND low nutrition adequacy”). This gives policymakers targeted intervention insights.

4. Downloadable Reports (Policymakers)
•	How to do it:
o	Add an “Export to PDF/Excel” button on your dashboard.
o	Tools: Python (Plotly + Pandas → ReportLab for PDF), Tableau (built-in export), Power BI (built-in export).
o	Reports should auto-generate with charts, maps, and recommendations.
👉 Stand out by including auto-policy recommendations:
•	Example: “District X shows 80% drought exposure and 50% nutrition adequacy. Recommendation: Prioritize irrigation projects and food supply interventions.”

🌟 What Will Make You Stand Out and Win
Judges will see a lot of dashboards. To rise above, focus on:
1.	Early Warning Alerts 📡
o	SMS/Email alerts when a district’s risk level crosses a danger threshold.
o	Example: “Kasese district just dropped below 40% nutrition adequacy. Immediate action recommended.”
2.	Scenario Simulation 🎛️
o	Policymakers can adjust variables (“What if rainfall drops 10%?”) → Dashboard recalculates affected regions.
o	This shows policy impact before action.
3.	Mobile-First / Offline Friendly 📱
o	Many decision-makers in Africa don’t have powerful laptops.
o	Make sure it works on low-bandwidth and mobile phones.
o	Optional: lightweight Android app wrapper for your dashboard.
4.	Local Language Support 🌍
o	Add toggle to display key metrics in Luganda, Swahili, French.
o	This breaks barriers for community-level planners.
5.	Human Stories Layer 🧑‍🌾
o	Alongside charts, show community-level testimonials or photos (even fictional but realistic case profiles).
o	Example: “Farmer Grace in Lira District is affected by recurrent droughts → Policy response: irrigation subsidy.”

🏛️ How Policymakers Benefit
•	Quick insights, not raw data → They don’t have time to analyze CSVs.
•	Targeted interventions → Filters + maps help them prioritize vulnerable areas.
•	Evidence-based planning → Trends + forecasts show where to invest.
•	Accountability → Downloadable reports allow them to present decisions to stakeholders (NGOs, donors, citizens).
•	Preparedness → Early warnings help them respond before crises escalate.
